##Cześć świat!

I thought finally to put out some real content since everything else except image handling have been added to the layout. At least in the way I thought it should be. This post passes a milestone, which was started roughly around November 2012. Then, I had an idea to put out some words about living in Poland as a foreigner. In Finnish. Well, it didn't take *that* long to put construct the blog and put the words out - I actually put out a first version of the blog with Wordpress platform with few posts only to realise that it's way too massive to my needs and ultimately ended up not to work with it anymore. That doesn't mean I don't have anything to show and tell about although this post doesn't go necessarily anywhere special.  The past few years in Poland has been a trip (believe it or not!) and I've been very lucky to have a chance to experience it. A lot of the credit goes to my lovely wife J for making life here possible. 

##About the blog

Behind the blog is a dead-simple Jekyll install with slight layout modification, served from Github Pages. Things can be really simple with Jekyll. Generally I love minimalistic approach in websites, so I attempted to bring few elements about nightlife and Warsaw. Why night? I mostly have time to write something during the night and the darker tones are closer to personal taste. Also the word "noc" (night) is one of the neutral words in the Polish language I like.  Maybe in the future I will add more details to the layout but that remains to be seen. I will add some photos here probably via Lightbox2 here later.
